# Using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT with CircuitPython

This repository contains code that illustrates how to interface the Raspberry Pi
Sense HAT with the CircuitPython.  It relies on [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/),
so this code should also work on any microcontroller compatible with CircuitPython.
More detailed descriptions of how these tests work can be found on
[this website](https://www.glennklockwood.com/electronics/sense-hat.html).

## Installation

    sudo apt install python3-venv
    python3 -mvenv adafruit
    . adafruit/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
